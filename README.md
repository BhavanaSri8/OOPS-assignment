# 🏦 Children's Bank System (Java OOP Project)

A comprehensive **Children's Bank System** developed in **Java**, designed to demonstrate strong **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and clean software engineering practices.

This project serves as an educational example of how core Java concepts such as **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction** can be applied in a real-world banking simulation.

---

## ✨ Project Overview

The Children's Bank System is a simple banking application where users can:

- Create bank accounts  
- Deposit and withdraw money  
- Check account balance  
- View transaction-like operations  
- Understand banking workflows using OOP structure  

This project is mainly focused on learning **Java OOP concepts** through practical implementation.

## ✅ Key Features

- 🧒 Beginner-friendly banking simulation  
- 🔐 Secure handling of account data using encapsulation  
- 📌 Modular design with clean separation of concerns  
- 🏗️ Demonstrates SOLID principles  
- 🔄 Interface-based implementation for flexibility  
- 🧩 Supports clean architecture patterns  

---

## 🏛️ Architecture Explanation

The system is designed using proper OOP architecture:

- Each banking entity is represented as a class  
- Responsibilities are divided across multiple modules  
- Business logic is separated from user interaction  
- Interfaces are used for dependency injection and scalability
